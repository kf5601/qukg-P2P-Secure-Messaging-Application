## Protocol Specification

### Connection Establishment
[Describe the full connection handshake]

```
Peer A                          Peer B
  |                                |
  |-------- [Step 1] ------------->|
  |<------- [Step 2] --------------|
  |-------- [Step 3] ------------->|
  |                                |
```

### Message Flow
[Describe how messages flow through the system]

### Peer Discovery Protocol
[Describe UDP broadcast format and discovery process]

#### Broadcast Message Format
```
[Format of discovery broadcast]
```

#### Discovery Process
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. ...

### Heartbeat Protocol
[Describe heartbeat mechanism]

- **Interval:** [e.g., 5 seconds]
- **Timeout:** [e.g., 15 seconds]
- **Action on timeout:** [e.g., mark as disconnected, attempt reconnect]

## P2P Architecture

### Peer Management
[Describe how peers are tracked and managed]

### Connection Strategy
[Describe how connections are established and maintained]

### Message Routing
[Describe how messages are routed between peers]

---

## Resilience Features

### Failure Detection
[Describe how connection failures are detected]

### Automatic Reconnection
[Describe your reconnection strategy]

- **Initial delay:** [e.g., 1 second]
- **Backoff strategy:** [e.g., exponential, max 30 seconds]
- **Max attempts:** [e.g., 5]

### Graceful Degradation
